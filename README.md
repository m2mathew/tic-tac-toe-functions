# Tic-Tac-Toe with Functions

Assignment from The Iron Yard-Austin

Week 2 - day 9

## Description
Implement the functions for a tic tac toe game


## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you shouldâ€¦

* Understand how to write functions
* Understand how to run unit tests
* Get better at reading documentation and learn some programmer jargon


### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you be able to effectively use

* Use npm to run your unit tests
* Basic JavaScript functions

## Details

### Deliverables

* A repo containing at least:
  * `scripts/main.js`
  * `scripts/gameFunctions.js`

### Requirements

* No ESLint warnings or errors
* All of the unit tests should pass


## Normal Mode
1. Fork this repository by clicking the fork button on the upper right corner of this page. This will copy the repository on to your GitHub account.
2. Clone **the forked version** of the repository. When you copy the clone URL it should have your github username in it **not TIY-Austin-Front-End-Engineering**.
3. Read through the scripts/gameFunctions.js file in your cloned repo. Develop an understanding of what each function is supposed to do based on the comments.
4. For each function write out with pen and paper the arguments that are getting passed into the function. For each argument write out...
	* the type of data (string, number, boolean, array, object) that it should be
	* one example valid value that could be passed in to that argument
5. For each function write out with pen and paper
	* in english: what should be returned from the function?
	* what type should the return value be?
	* one example of a valid return value
6. Complete each of the functions except for the last one (getComputerPlayerMove).

## Hard Mode
Finish the getComputerPlayerMove function.


## Notes

You will need to run the `npm install` command to install all of the necessary dependencies for this project. When you run `npm install` the node package manager will look at the package.json file and install everything that is listed as a dependency or devDependency.

You can test to see if the function is working as expected by running the command `npm test`. This will run through the unit tests and let you know if anything is failing a test. When you begin everything will be failing. As you complete the functions, the tests should start to pass.

You can play the actual game by running the command `node scripts/main.js`.
